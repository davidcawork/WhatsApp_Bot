## Requirements

You have to have Selenium installed to make an import of the package. In addition, your version of Google Chrome must be compatible with chromedriver v70-73.

## Usage

The use is very simple, first of all you can open your console, powershell, interpreter of Python and execute the script.

Next, the Whatsapp web page will be opened, which will require your QR authentication. Once authenticated, confirm by pressing any key on the tool.

Finally, to send messages you must use this syntax and not another since messages will not be sent.
